# Objectives
In this lab, you will use the CLI commands to verify the operation of an existing OSPFv2 network.<br>
In Part 2, you will add a new LAN to the configuration and verify connectivity.
- Identify and verify the status of OSPF neighbors.
- Determine how the routes are being learned in the network.
- Explain how the neighbor state is determined.
- Examine the settings for the OSPF process ID.
- Add a new LAN into an existing OSPF network and verify connectivity.
# Background / Scenario
You are the network administrator for a branch office of a larger organization. Your branch is adding a new 
wireless network into an existing branch office LAN. The existing network is configured to exchange routes 
using OSPFv2 in a single-area configuration. Your task is to verify the operation of the existing OSPFv2 
network, before adding in the new LAN. When you are sure that the current OSPFv2 LAN is operating 
correctly, you will connect the new LAN and verify that OSPF routes are being propagated for the new LAN. 
As branch office network administrator, you have full access to the IOS on routers R3 and R4. You only have 
read access to the enterprise LAN routers R1 and R2, using the username BranchAdmin, and the password 
Branch1234.

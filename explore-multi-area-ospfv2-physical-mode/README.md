# Background / Scenario
## Part 1: The Beginning
Casual Recording Company (CRC), based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, provides self-serve, mini-recording studios 
around the city so that anyone can rent a timeslot and record their songs by themselves. CRC began with a 
single-area OSPF network located in one building. This idea was very popular and consequently the business 
has grown, causing the company to expand into a branch office in a second building at the far end of the city. 
They continued to use single-area OSPF. You will evaluate the impact of the expanded network.
## Part 2: Business is Booming
The IT department in CRC decided to migrate to a multiarea OSPF network. You will evaluate the impact and 
benefits derived from the change to determine if it was a good decision or not.
## Part 3: CRC Expansion Continues
CRC has continued to grow and will open a new branch office in Montevideo, Uruguay. You will configure the 
Area Border Router for the new area and physically connect the branch office network to the corporate 
headquarters network through the internet.

# Objectives
Part 1: Propagate a Default Route<br>
Part 2: Verify Connectivity
# Background
In this activity, you will configure an IPv4 default route to the Internet and propagate that default route to other 
OSPF routers. You will then verify the default route is in downstream routing tables and that hosts can now 
access a web server on the Internet.

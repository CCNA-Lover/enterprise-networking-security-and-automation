# Objectives
Part 1: Configure Router IDs.<br>
Part 2: Configure Networks for OSPF Routing.<br>
Part 3: Configure Passive Interfaces.<br>
Part 4: Verify OSPF configuration.<br>
# Background 
In this activity, you will activate OSPF routing using network statements and wildcard masks, configuring 
OSPF routing on interfaces, and by using network statements quad-zero masks. In addition, you will configure 
explicit router IDs and passive interfaces.
